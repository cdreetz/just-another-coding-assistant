# Coding Interview Prep Assistant

- Select what kind of problem you want to cover
- A problem will be created
- Write your code in the code editor
- Save code to include it in your chat
- Ask questions with your AI assistant, general questions, hints, guidance, the meaning of life, even full code solutions. The power is yours
  


### Setup

- Clone repo
- npm i
- Add API key to .env
- npm run dev



### TODO

- Create problem generator function
- Add button to code editor to 'Check Code', which sends a message in the chat like
user: Check this code: {code}

The UI only shows {code} but the message sent includes the actual code, try to keep actual code out of chat so its cleaner
